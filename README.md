# Alpaca Trading Analytics Dashboard
#### A dashboard for users of the alapaca trading api.

This project will be developed as a website by a team of 4 (Kyle Hays, Chris Cautivar, Frida Unneberg, Adam Ayala). This project would fill the User interface gap currently lacking for the alpaca trading api. Using a website as our application offers the ability for users to access the application from any platform without code modifications. By the completion of our project we hope to have a minimal viable product that displays the stocks in a users alpaca portfolio, along with buy/sell actions for each stock. 


## Usage  

The application was built utilizing Angular 8 with a Spring Boot backend. 

This application will be fully deployed to heroku.
